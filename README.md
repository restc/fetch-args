fetch-args
==========

A Ruby tool to find the correct usage for ArgumentError blunders on the command line.

#Usage
• add `require 'path/to/.../require.rb'` to ~./irbrc or load 'require.rb' in session
• any ArgumentError will grab the correct usage for that method.

Work in progress.
Currently uses ruby-doc.org for docs
Would love any feedback.

Plans:

Tests!
Cleaner output!
Squishing bugs!
Probably lots of other stuff
